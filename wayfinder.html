        <p>Wayfinder is a financial wellness tool offered by <a href="https://greatwestlife.com">Great-West Life</a> that
           helps Canadians plan and save for retirement. Launched as a pilot web
           service, the platform allows members to combine their workplace
           retirement plans and savings to see how they can improve their financial outcomes.</p><br>

          <h1>Research</h1>
          <p>Our goal was for members to plan their financial goals, act on financial advice to
            achieve their goals faster, and sustain their financial wellness
            through Wayfinder. Finance is a very daunting subject that affects
            us every day and our intent was to make it more fun and easy to plan
            for something like retirement. Our design team worked with UX researchers and found three key learnings from our
            research:</p>
          <p><strong>Users have no time for financial planning.</strong> Financial planning wasn’t a huge
            priority for them, especially if they have kids or are already retired.
            With life happening, they don’t have time to shop around for rates
            or develop comprehensive financial plans.</p>
          <p><strong>Advice comes from everywhere.</strong> Some users find value in peer advice, others
            gather information from family or newspapers, and some put all of
            their faith in a financial advisor and are willing to pay for their services.</p>
          <p><strong>Retirement comes last.</strong> Immediate financial burdens
            take precedence over long-term saving. Some users felt that they
            couldn’t think about saving for retirement until their debts are
            gone. That said, many passively save by contributing to their bank
            investments but continue to keep their eye on smaller goals such as
            purchasing a house or paying for an education.</p>

      <div class="main flex-center-h">
        <h1>Wireframing the experience</h1>
          <p>Based on our research and inspiration from other banks and fintech
            platforms, we emphasized our design research on three key flows: onboarding (helping a member plan their financial goals in an effortless, timely manner),
            navigating the platform (helping the member understand their financial wellness at an overview level while getting more details at a goal-specific level),
            and maintenance (allowing a member to aggregate bank investments through a third party service; getting advice from a certified financial advisor through a third party service; using recommendation cards as a way to suggest financial advice for specific goals and accounts).</p>

          <br>
          <h1>User testing our hypotheses</h1>
          <p>We tested our wireframes using Google’s HEART framework with a pool
            of 20 users that were similar to the personas our UX researchers came
            to us with. Our overall goal was to determine whether users felt
            comfortable with using the product and to validate that our key flows
            were quick, seamless and easy to understand. We tasked our users with
            registering for an account and setting up their retirement plan, in
            addition to determining and correcting a financial shortfall in one of their goals.</p>
          <p>Our results came back with positive feedback: users found it very
            easy to navigate through the platform and some minor miscommunications
            only required design and copy tweaking. Many of our users found the
            platform helpful, but also felt skeptical about aggregating accounts
            because of platform credibility and security.</p>

          <h1>Design decisions</h1>
          <p>After our first round of user testing, we looked at different ways
            we could approach our design and colour palette.
            As an extension of Great-West Life, we kept it in-line with their brand
            colour, green, and introduced grays and blues.
            Our goal was to keep the design light and uncluttered.</p>
          <p>We wanted to make saving for retirement easier for the user to understand.
            We worked together with the client and their copywriter to help us
            understand retirement and break it down in a simpler way. This was very important to the onboarding
            experience and the way that users interact with recommendation cards
            because we wanted users to act with certainty and without worry.</p>
          <p>People have other goals between now and retirement, but we still
            wanted to emphasize overall financial wellness. Life happens and we want to help people
            prepare for that speed bump. Using hierarchy in layout, typography
            and colour, we highlight the wealth curve as soon as the user lands
            on the dashboard, but we also give them an at-a-glance of their other goals.
            We avoided using red for alerts on the dashboard
            because we felt it was intrusive and might negatively convey
            a critical problem with their finances. Instead, we opted for yellow,
            in contrast to green, to let users know that they have a shortfall
            that they need to correct.</p>

          <br>
          <h1>Challenges</h1>
          <p><strong>Accessibility.</strong> We found out later in the design
            process/early in development that the client wanted to meet WCAG
            Level AA standards. We had to redefine our colour palette because a
            lot of our design elements weren’t meeting the contrast ratios,
            especially our recommendation cards. This led to deadline pushbacks
            due to file adjustment and sign-off on new colour palettes. </p>
          <p><strong>User testing.</strong> Upon further research and experience,
            I discovered that there were better tools that assess how a user
            interacts with wireframes (we used InVision, which validated flows
            instead of the elaborate interactions). The way we set up the test
            also felt too prescribed, having added colour to our wireframes
            (many of our users thought the wireframes were high-fidelity designs).</p>

          <br>
          <h1>Takeaway</h1>
          <p>Wayfinder was the first project I led from start to finish as a
            senior lead designer, working with several members of our design team,
            as well as our Creative Director. I learned some of my most valuable
            lessons as a designer with this project and this became a catalyst
            for my hunger for better experience and interface design. Some key takeaways:</p>
          <p><strong>Accessibility isn’t always ugly.</strong> We have a responsibility
            as designers to aim for inclusion, not WCAG levels. Accessibility isn’t
            always hard and isn’t always ugly, especially if we think about accessibility
            at the beginning of our projects and continue to keep it under consideration
            as we go through different phases of the project. <a href="img/wayfinder/KG-PowerHour-Accessiblility-v2-LM.pdf" target="_blank">I led a presentation
            about the importance of accessibility</a>, with an emphasis on design best
            practices—our best practices align with accessible design, so we shouldn’t
            have to think of it as a separate checkbox.</p>
          <p><strong>We need 100% team transparency.</strong> We are experts at
            design, but just because the user experience and interface is beautiful
            doesn’t always mean it’s possible or right. Working around business
            requirements, deadlines and technical restraints happens all the time
            with projects; our weekly check-ins and open discussions on Slack allowed
            us to transparently communicate what could be done within our resources
            and finding common ground.</strong>
          <p><strong>Dive deeper.</strong> We put our best foot forward with our
            designs. Although we anticipated more rounds of user testing, we were
            unable to test our designs before launch due to resource restraints.
            There were still many questions that needed to be answered and many
            decisions that needed to be validated. If there was an opportunity to
            maintain the product, I’d like to do further research and testing to
            find more ways to make the platform more efficient for the member to
            use, and how we could make the product more sustainable and usable so
            that the user thinks to use Wayfinder when they think of their financial wellness.</p>
