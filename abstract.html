        <p><em>Abstract Magazine</em> is a concept print and web publication that showcases
          local artists, photographers and writers that use their talent to address
          socio-political issues. The editorial is meant to empower and keep
          mature readers (post-secondary education, young adults) informed of the urban landscape.</p>

          <h1>Defining the brand</h1>
          <p>I analyzed competitors in print and web (including Pound Magazine,
            Manifesto, Respect, Rap Season, The Fader and Complex) to help me
            think about how I wanted the brand to connect with readers.</p>
          <p><em>Abstract’s</em> personality should come from thought-provoking content
            and bold visuals. The publication is meant to educate readers in a
            way that explores their own thoughts and ideas, help them understand
            what is happening in their community and how they can take action to help.
            The brand is in the integrity of the content.</p>

        <h1>Creating the logo</h1>
          <p><em>Abstract’s</em> competitors use variations of boxed logos and
            bold, uppercase logotypes, many of which are black and red. While it
            shows strength in structure and colour, I wanted <em>Abstract</em> to
            stand out by introducing a logo that shows flexibility in personality.
            The urban arts is abstract: it’s a free form that allows a person to
            define themselves in their own way with purpose, through every beat,
            word and movement.</p>

          <h2>The editorial experience in a digital space</h2>
          <p>Translating a print editorial into a digital space made me more aware
            of how users interact with publications on the internet. Users are
            less inclined to subscribe or go out of their way to visit a blog
            because social media outlets like Twitter, Reddit and Facebook make
            it easier for them to access and digest content, whether it’s a post
            from a friend or suggested/advertised posts.</p>
          <br>
          <h1>Interviews and personas</h1>
          <p>I spoke with some friends (and potential target users) of <em>Abstract</em>.
            Knowing that they interact with my competitors’ content on a regular
            basis, I asked questions about how they discover new music and news,
            how they keep up with trends in music, fashion and lifestyle and what
            they liked and didn’t like about the current reading experience of
            competitor websites.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Manny</strong>, 24, hip hop enthusiast and photographer
                for a streetwear boutique; goes out of his way to look for
                streetwear/music news on specific blogs; heavily invested in
                thought-provoking articles and well-designed brands; does not
                engage in social media but will click into the odd Facebook link
                that his friends post</li>
              <li><strong>Matt</strong>, 25, music and streetwear enthusiast,
                frequented Hypemachine until Spotify automated the process with
                playlists; frequently sends music links and articles to friends
                via direct messages</li>
              <li><strong>Kris</strong>, 32, hip hop purist; only interested in
                music updates from older hip hop artists; finds music content on
                Spotify and social media (Twitter/Reddit); doesn’t share content
                often but likes content and comments on social media</li>
              <li><strong>Tahir</strong>, 24, aspiring rapper; usually finds new music via Soundcloud;
                heavy social media browser; doesn’t care to share content via social media</li>
              <li><strong>Allan</strong>, 35, active Toronto DJ and radio personality; unconcerned
                by the artist gossip, more concerned with the music; likes to see
                and keep track of new talent; will share content if it’s relevant
                to his peers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I found that all personas discover most of their music/lifestyle
              news via social media and don’t actively keep an eye on specific blogs.
              When they do read an article, they tend to explore other parts of
              the website once they finish reading, mostly because of related articles.
              Music platforms like Spotify make it easier for them to find music
              (Discovery Weekly, related artists, Release Radar), instead of digging
              for music that’s buried in artist news on blogs.</p>

      <p class="caption">Mapping out how some of my interviewees interact with competitor blogs</p>

        <div class="main flex-center-h">
          <h1>Discovering pain points</h1>
          <p>With the help of some friends, I mapped out how readers currently
            interacts with some of the competitor blogs to define any pain points
            a reader might have from the time that they click on a link on
            social media, to the time they leave the website.</p>
          <p>Most of the pain points are found when the reader is interacting
            with an article (“why do they insist of having me subscribe?”
            “Where’s the share button?” “Where can I read more?”). Other pain
            points are things that speaks more to the integrity of the brand
            (“Is this clickbait?” “Is this a trusted source?”).</p>
          <br>
          <h1>User Journey takeaways</h1>
          <p><strong>Subscribing should be inviting, not intrusive.</strong>
            Readers are more inclined to follow brands on Twitter or Facebook so
            that it's integrated into their social media. Instead of having a full-screen
            takeover, we can ask our readers to subscribe in a way that's less
            intrusive, like asking for an email at the end of an article.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Sharing is caring.</strong> Hip hop is built on a community
            that thrives on debate and discussion and <em>Abstract</em> should
            emphasize that. A comments section after an article would not be
            useful for the publication because it often invites unwarranted and
            unfiltered banter. Music is subjective and the discussion is not always
            inviting with strangers that have strong opinions. Instead, sharing
            a link to social media should be readily available and easy to
            interact with. The most valuable dialogue for readers are on social
            media, with peers that share the same hobbies.</p>
          <p><strong>More food for thought.</strong> The experience should allow
            readers to find new content after they finish reading an article so
            that readers may stay longer and read more articles.</p>
          <br>
          <h1>Wireframes</h1>
          <p>As I began to wireframe the digital experience, there were a few
            things I wanted to keep in mind after discussing with target users
            what worked and didn’t work with their favourite blogs and my own
            list of inspiration:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep a minimal aesthetic with bold imagery; word-heavy where it matters</li>
            <li>Readable content and keeping in mind contrast in type size,
              weight, spacing, fonts and colour for both desktop and mobile</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="photo-set flex-center">
          <div><img class="lazy" data-src="img/abstract/process-5.jpg" alt="Abstract Magazine: wireframes"></div>
        </div>
        <p class="caption">Approached the organization of articles by panel,
          leading with Featured Articles, Music Discovery, then Latest News so
          the reader can continue to load more news if they are interested.</p>

        <div class="main flex-center-h">
          <p>There are three things a reader is likely to be looking for on the
            home page: latest news, new music, and featured articles. I surfaced
            the featured articles first because these are the thought-provoking
            articles that speak most to the brand. Having the Latest News section
            at the end of the home page in a list makes it easier for people to
            scan news that might be relevant to them.</p>
          <br>
          <h1>Takeaway</h1>
          <p>This project helped me discover that content drives the success of
            a publication. Brands speak to their target audience through their
            language on social media and their articles. Readers don’t frequent
            specific websites when looking for news, but instead look to social
            media outlets like Facebook and Twitter. In the future, I’d like to
            explore more ways that I could help users share content faster and
            easier.</p>
